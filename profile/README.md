# Mobile Apps Development | Team 22

### Welcome! 

In here you will find the code repositories for the project, alongside the documenation (In its own repo).

This is part of the course of mobile development, focusing on developing for flutter and kotlin.


### Project management structure:
Each repository has a project associated, consisting of the 4 sprints marked as milestones and as part of each issue.

In the documentation repository will be all issues associated to making changes to the wiki and group work.

Each of the other repos have only issues that are particular to the platform being worked on.

That way, each subgroup has a board and there is a general board for the whole 6 person team.
